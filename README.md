# Assessing factors affecting inter-state relations in the USA

## Description
The Michigan State University assembled statistics of various Socioeconomic characteristics of all the states in the USA. These statistics include interstate linkages dealing with trade, migration, political ideology, institutions, population demographics, geography and also informal ones such as share of facebook friends in other states, perceived similarity with people from other states. This visual analysis looks at the relationship between state characteristics and linkages between the population of those states.


## Data
The data is from Michigan State University's Institute for Public Policy and Social Research College of Social Science. The State Networks dataset is a compilation of many state-to-state relational variables, including measures of shared borders, travel and trade between states, and demographic characteristics of state populations. The 2,550 units in the dataset are dyadic state-pairs (e.g., Alabama–Alaska, Alabama–Arizona, Alabama–Arkansas, and so on, for each state plus the District of Columbia). The data were collected from multiple sources and incorporate measures of similarity drawn from data in the <a href = "https://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy">Correlates of State Policy Project</a>.
